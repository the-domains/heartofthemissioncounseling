My approach to psychotherapy is humanistic, holistic, and integrative.

Everyone is different and together we will discover and explore healing modalities that will work best for you.

Our therapeutic work together is:

\*client-centered

(you lead the way in your own wellness)

\*empowering

(strengthening empowerment tools together)

\*humanistic

(considering creativity, wholeness and spirituality)

\*holistic

(bringing in all parts of you)

\*integrative

(using a variety of methods and techniques)

\*mindfulness based

(practicing mindfulness to support health-including somatic awareness)

\*psychodynamic

(exploring how our past is connected to who we are today)

\*collaborative

(sharing ideas, strategies and stories together)

**_About Me_**

I am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT \#91169) with a Masters Degree in Counseling Psychology in Community Mental Health from the California Institute of Integral Studies and a BA in Women's Studies from CSU Long Beach.

I have over 15 years of experience working in community mental health with diverse and traditionally marginalized communities including; older adults with severe and persistent mental illness, formerly incarcerated folks, individuals in recovery from substance use, LGBTQ (particularly transgender and non binary) communities, survivors of domestic and sexual violence, trauma survivors, foster care youth and people living with HIV.

In my work I have prioritized grassroots HIV prevention, organizing, advocacy and education. Activism is a beautiful window through which healing and spiritual growth can happen, and for me has been an essential pathway for my own personal development as a mental health professional.

Using a social justice framework, I believe in looking at the individual as well as the systems in which we all find ourselves for a deeper and richer understanding.
